The mapping of system hostnames and ip addresses of lab machines is stored in hosts.properties.
If trying to test it on other machines, added system hostname and ip address in the propertie 
file before running the program. It is used to verify the ip addresses when running add host subcommand.

Linda subcommands include "add", "in", "rd", "out".
Also, "quit" subcommand is added in order to quit the program safely instead of pressing ctrl+c.

The console output follows the same format of examples in the Programming Assignment #2.
Also, both server and client will show the output if any event occurs.

To run the program:
Under P2 folder:
1. make clean
	Run it in order to clean up previous test tuple files
	it cleans *.class under the P2 folder
2. gmake
	it compiles all the java file
3. java P2 $hostname
	choose any customized hostname which you preferred.
